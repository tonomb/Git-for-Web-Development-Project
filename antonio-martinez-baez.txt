Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
         an inline element dont have a specific width, they cover whatever is inside them. block elements have a default width of 100%  this means they start on a new line every time. 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        the element can be positiond relative to the parent element. you can fix the top, bottom, right or left of the element.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        you give it the property of inline-block

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        inline  
            span
            a
            img
            
        block
            div
            h1
            
        inline-block
            button

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

        the box model refers to the variables we can change in an element.  All elements have a margin, border, padding and a width.  The size of an element is the sum of all of them. if you set width to 100 it still adds a margin,padding and border. this makes the element bigger.

        you can use the box-sizing: border-box property to include the border and padding in the width. This will make it so they dont add to the width after the fact.
